I
 need to modify the `src/hello.py`
 file to:
1. Create
 a `main
` function that passes a string to a
 `greeting` function
2. Create a
 `greeting` function that prints the string
 it receives
3. The current
 file just has a simple
 print statement

I have the file content already
 provided, so I don
't need to read it again. I can
 use the `apply_diff` tool to
 modify the existing file by
 replacing the current content with the new structure
.

Let me plan the new structure:
- A
 `greeting(message)` function that prints the message

- A `main()
` function that calls
 `greeting()
` with a string

- A `if
 __name__ == "__main__":
` block to call
 main() when the script is run directly

</thinking>

I'll modify the
 [`src/hello.py`](src
/hello.py:
1) file to add a main
 function and a greeting
 function as
 requested.

<apply
_diff>
<path
>src/hello.py</path

def greeting(message):
    """
Print the given message."""
    print(message)


def main():
    """Main function
 that passes a string to the greeting function."""

    greeting("Hello, World")


if __name__ == "__main

    main()

</diff>

</apply_diff>

<attempt

<result>
I've
 successfully modified [`src/hello.py`](src
/hello.py:1) to
 include the requested structure:

1. **`
greeting(message)`** function - Takes
 a string parameter and prints it
2
. **`main()`** function - Passes
 the string "Hello, World" to the greeting function

3. **`if __name__ == "__main__"
:`** block - Ensures main
() is called when the script is run directly

The
 file now has a proper function-
based structure where the
 main function passes a string to the greeting function, an
d the greeting function handles
 printing the message.
