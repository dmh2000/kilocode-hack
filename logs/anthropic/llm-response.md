I need to modify the `src/hello.py`
 file to:
1. Create a `
main` function that passes a string to a `
greeting` function
2. Create a `greeting` function that prints the string
 it receives
3. The current file just
 has a simple print statement

I can see the
 current content of the file from the provided file
_content. I need to use the apply_diff tool to modify this
 file since it's an existing file and I want to make
 targeted changes.

Let me structure this
:
- Replace the current print statement with a proper main function an
d greeting function
- The main function should call the greeting function with a
 string parameter
- The greeting function should print the
 received string
- I should also add a
 `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to call
 main()
</thinking>

I'll modify the [`
src/hello.py`](src/hello.py:
1) file to include a main function and a greeting function as
 requested.

<result>
I've
 successfully modified [`src/hello.py`](src
/hello.py:1) to include the
 requested structure:

1. Create
d a [`greeting(message)`](src/hello.py
:1) function that takes a string parameter an
d prints it
2. Created a [`
main()`](src/hello.
py:4) function that passes
 the string "Hello, World" to the greeting function

3. Added the standard Python idiom `if __name__ == "__
main__":` to call the main function when the script is run
 directly

The file now has proper function
 structure with the main function calling the greeting function as requeste
d.
